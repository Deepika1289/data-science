1. **Project Objective📜**:

The main objective of the project is to develop a recommendation system that can suggest products to users based on their preferences and behavior. This enhances the user experience and can potentially increase sales for the e-commerce platform.

2. **Components of the System👇**:

*👉**Data Collection***: Gather data from user interactions, purchase history, product catalog, and user reviews.

*👉**Data Preprocessing***: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize data, and transform categorical variables.

*👉**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***: Analyze the data to understand user behavior, popular products, and trends.

*👉**Model Selection***: Choose appropriate recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.

*👉**Model Training***: Train the selected models using historical data.

*👉**Evaluation***: Evaluate the models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.

*👉**Deployment***: Deploy the model into a production environment where it can serve real-time recommendations.

3.**Implementation💻**:

   1.*Importing libraries*:
   
      begins by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, natural language processing, and machine learning.

  2.*Data Collection*:

     The dataset is loaded into a dataframe .
     
  3.*Displaying Data*:

  Some settings are configured to display data, followed by displaying a specific product name.

  4.*Checking for Duplicates*:

  checks for duplicate entries in the dataset

  5*Data preprocessing*:

  steps for preprocessing the data:

Converting product names to lowercase.
Removing the main and sub-category columns.
Removing non-alphanumeric characters from product names.

4.**DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF THE PROJECT🧑‍💻**:


 ***Data Collection📼***:
This section involves importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a DataFrame.


***Data Preprocessing***:
The data preprocessing steps include:

->Displaying product names and checking for duplicate entries.

->Converting product names to lowercase for uniformity.

->Removing unnecessary columns (like main category and sub-category).

->Removing non-alphanumeric characters.

->Applying stemming to reduce words to their root form.

 ***Feature Extraction***:
 
The CountVectorizer is used to convert the processed text data into numerical vectors, which are essential for calculating similarities between products.

***Similarity Calculation🧮***:

The cosine similarity between the product vectors is computed to identify similar products.


***Recommender Function***:

A function to recommend products based on the similarity scores is defined and tested with a sample product.


***Memory Usage📼***:
The memory usage of the similarity matrix and the DataFrame is checked to ensure the system's efficiency.

***Model Evaluation***:

Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE.

User Testing: Test the recommendations with real users and collect feedback.

***Model Deployment***:

Web Integration: Integrate the recommendation system with an e-commerce platform using web frameworks like Flask or Django.

API Development: Develop APIs to serve real-time recommendations.
